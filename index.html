            <h2>Pong</h2>
            <h5><time datetime="2023-03-01">March 1, 2023</time></h5>
            
            <h4 class="q1">What I worked on today</h4>
            <p>Today I worked a little more on my resume. I got the social icons on there and formatted a bit more. I will finish it next week. I need to think about what projects to add on there. </p>
            <p>Most of my time was spent creating Pong. I made classes for the ball, the paddles, and the scoreboard. On my main file, I called these and started the main 'while' sequence. 
                While the game is happening, the ball will move in an angle left or right. Each player will use either Up and Down or W and S to control their paddles, using event listeners for those keys.
                The players try to hit the ball away, bouncing off the top and bottom or hitting to their opponent. The objective is to get it past your opponent without them stopping it. The scoreboard keeps
                track of points and displays them at the top of the screen. Each time a ball passes a player, the other player scores. Then the ball will reset in the middle. This happens until someone reaches the score of 10.
            </p>
            <h4 class="q2">What I need to return to</h4>
            <p>I don't have much programming time this week. If I come back, it will be to work on my resume or start looking at my next 100days project.</p>
            <h4 class="q3">What I had issues with or excelled at</h4>
            <p>I feel like I am really excelling at objects and classes. I am enjoying debugging my programs. Today I had an issues on my scoreboard class and it took a bit to figure out the issues. I finally found that there was a misnamed attribute. I enjoyed searching the code and trying 
                different things to find the issue.
            </p>
            <h4 class="q4">Notes</h4>
            <p>Next week the ADA application opens. Until then, I will think about the general questions that I know will be on there. I will make outlines and talking points for each. I may start to write small blurbs so I can figure out what 200-250 words (or I'll have to double check the word limit) looks like.</p>

            <h4 class="q1">What I worked on today</h4>
            <p>I worked on my resume a bit. I decided to use Adobe InDesign to make my resume formatted as well as possible. I have made some progress but have a little more work to do on it.</p>
            <p>I mostly worked on the Snake Game today following 100 days of code. It helped a lot with understanding and practicing Object Oriented Programming.</p>

            <h2>Turtles!</h2>
            <h5><time datetime="2023-02-22">February 22, 2023</time></h5>
            
            <h4 class="q1">What I worked on today</h4>
            <p><ul>
                <li>I finished my quiz program! I imported data from a site that has questions and answers. I reformatted that and put it into my game.</li>
                <li>I worked a bunch with Turtle graphics and event listeners. I practiced using Turtle, objects, and classes.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spirograph programs: I made two programs involving random colors and commanding the turtle to make repeating circles. The second spirograph program
                        also added pointed lines.
                    </li>
                    <li>I made a dot drawing inspired by Hirst. I found a color pallette and used a module to grab colors from that. I made the turtle choose random colors from that pallette and draw dots.</li>
                    <li>I made the turtle draw shapes with increasing sides, from a triangle with three sides up to a 10-sided polygon.</li>
                    <li>I made the turtle do a random walk.</li>
                    <li>Etch-a-Sketch! This had me practice using event listeners. The program would listen for me to press WASD keys for movement or to change directions accordingly. I made 
                        a version where up and down mean forward and backward and right and left let you turn. I made another version where right, left, up, and down would make you face that specific direction immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lastly, I made a turtle racing program. I made turtle objects from the turtle class. Each has a different color and starting position. The user will place a bet on which turtle they hope to win, and then the turtles will each move forward at random paces until one reaches the finish line. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul></p>
            <h4 class="q2">What I need to return to</h4>
            <p>I want to create something similar to the turtle racing game and similar to the board game, Camel Up. It should involve betting and changing bets. Instead of one long run, there will a couple stops.</p>
            <h4 class="q3">What I had issues with or excelled at</h4>
            <p>I don't think I had any issues today. Maybe a couple at the beginning while figuring out how to use the Turtle module, but otherwise it went well today.</p>
            <h4 class="q4">Notes</h4>
            <p>Next week I need to work on my resume for my ADA application</p>
            <p>Soon I want to update the trash buddies site. I need to make it fully responsive and prettier, as well as add a real working dark mode. I also need to add more chapters as soon as I have time to write. </p>
            <p>I also want to start thinking about implementing the two games I have planned(the trash buddies mystery and dark abyss). I know more about OOP and using libraries, etc. so I can see how those can be useful
                for my projects and start making concrete plans.

                    <li>I redesigned my coffee program to use oop. The main file was so much cleaner and shorter, and it imported from three different files</li>
                    <ul><li>
                        I didn't create the other 3 files in the tutorial, just my main.py</li>

            <h4 class="q1">What I worked on today</h4>
            <p>I did a little bit of work from 100 Days of Code, as well as from Harvard's cs50P course. I also edited
                my file with notes, and updated this blog with minimal HTML changes.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <h4>More in depth:</h4>
            <li>I made a Higher or Lower game. Located in my Practice_Projects git repository</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For this, there is a file with a data set. Multiple dictionaries in a dictionary. Each dictionary contains a celebrity
                    name, their home country, their occupation, and how many instagram followers they have. This directory game straight from
                    the 100 Days of Code example, and I did not code anything in it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The program will output two celebrities with their occupation and country. It will have their follower counts ready to compare.
                    The user will choose which one they think has a higher follower count. If correct, they move on in the game. They gain a point, and
                    then whoever was the second celebrity displayed will be compared to a new celebrity. If they lose, the game is over.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>I updated my readme for the Practice_Projects</li>
            <li>I did some practice exercises about debugging</li>
            <li>I researched more about function parameters and return statements. I am still struggling a bit with it.</li>
            <li>I did problem sets for cs50p week 0</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Indoor voice: a user would input a string. program outputs it in all lowercase</li>
                <li>Playback speed: a user would input a string. program outputs the string but instead of spaces between words, there are '...'</li>
                <li>Making faces: a user would input a string. if there are ':)' or ':(' smileys, it would output the string while changing those to emojis</li>
                <li>Einstein: using E=mc^2, a user inputs a mass(in kilograms) and the program will output its' energy in joules</li>
                <li>Tip calculator: a user would input a total bill($xx.xx) and a percent to tip(xx%). The program removes the '$' and '%', converts both strings to floats, divides percent by 100, and returns the values.
                    Then the computer outputs how much to tip using 'tip = bill * percent'
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Lastly, I made most of a coffee program. You choose a drink option (latte, espresso, etc) and then the program checks
                to make sure all the needed ingredients are in stock. Next you put in coins, and the program makes sure you have enough money
                for the drink. It will give you change if too much money. Then it will give you the drink, and it will subtract the used resources. The user
                can get another drink or get a bakery item. I am currently stuck on the bakery part.
            </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4 class="q2">What I need to return to</h4>
            <p>I read most of the lecture 0 for cs50, put I have a little bit more. Since I know most of this material I am just reading the transcript
                instead of watching the videos. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="q3">What I had issues with or excelled at</h4>
            <p>I mostly had issues with the bakery part of my coffee project. Otherwise just small issues that I was able to work out.</p>
            <p>I think what I excelled at was debugging. Though I'm stuck on the bakery debugging, I feel confident in what I have been learning and coding.</p>
            <h4 class="q4">Notes</h4>
            <p>Currently getting an error in the bakery. TypeError: 'function' object is not subscriptable. I don't have time to finish today
                so I will come back to debugging next week! </p>
                <p>Though I am busy this weekend, I will try to study on SoloLearn or finish the CS50 lesson 0 or start lesson 1.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I worked on 100 days of code- day 11 to make a blackjack game</li>
                <li>I also worked on my readme.md for my Practice_Projects repository, which includes hangman, caesar cipher, and a few other games and programs.
                    I added an art.py file in that folder so that I could move ascii art from other programs to one file and then import them to the programs, instead of
                    clogging the programs up with art. 
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, I started this blog. It currently contains HTML and CSS, but I would like to add JS once I learn. My plan is to focus on Python and HTML/CSS until summer, and then start Javascript.</li>
                <ul><li>For this blog, I created a main.html, a projects.html, and a notes.html. I also created the main.css and main.js for when I make it.
                </li>
                <li>I started filling in the main blog page with entries I have been making in my phone. I will probably update on my phone daily and update this a few times a week or so.</li>

            <h4 class="q2">What I need to return to</h4>
            <p>I finished this project, but I could get some use out of coming back to look at how the return function worked in this program since I am struggling a little with understanding how it works.</p>
            <h4 class="q3">What I had issues with or excelled at</h4>
            <ul><li>
                I had a lot of issues getting program to work just right. I think I had a mistake in a loop but couldn't figure out where. I saved the full code of where my issues were located so I can go back another time
                to try to debug. But for today, instead of spending additional time debugging, I worked differently.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First I did the program all on my own. I typed functions how I thought they should work and loops.
                    </li>
                    <li>Next I compared mine to the example code in 100 days of code. I saw where there were differences and what we had the same.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, I made a new file and retyped the whole program. I looked at both my first program and the example program while typing the new one. I feel 
                        that this enabled me to see better where my mistakes were made, as well as what could be typed more efficiently.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
            <h4 class="q4">Notes</h4>
            <p>I think what I took most from today was that I need to work on return() function and understand better how it works. I made the blackjack program much more efficient using return() then simply print,
                as well as making sure to put parameters inside the function definitions. This made it easier to carry values between functions without making everything global. 
                ex. 
                def compare(user_score, comp_score)
            </p>
            <p>Some thoughts/affirmations:</p>
            <p>I know I am capable. I enjoy debugging and figuring out issues, and I am overall good at this. Though I had to look at examples more today to understand how to make the program work, that is okay.
                A big part of programming is knowing how to look up what you don't know. Overall, I am excited to continue learning Python, especially the parts that seem hard at first. Once I figure them out, it feels great. And I
                love that I am continuously able to create bigger and better things with each lesson I learn.

            <h2>Caesar Cipher, Silent Auction, and Hangman</h2>

            <h4 class="q1">What I worked on today</h4>
            <p>Today I worked through Python 100 days of code by Angela Wu on Udemy. I worked on finishing Hangman that I started the other day.
                One issue I am still having with it is getting the program to start over when completed.
            </p>
            
            <p>I also made a caesar cipher. This is a cipher where you can encode and decode different messages. You choose whether to encode or 
                decode, then you type your message and your shift number. According to the shift number, the program will display the message with the letters
                shifted to that amount. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The other program I worked on was a silent auction. From a small list, a random item will be chosen to auction. The first user will state their name and their bid. 
                Then, the program will ask if there is another bidder. If so, it will clear the screen allowing the next player to state their name and bid. Once all bids have 
                been made, the program will say who the highest bidder was and what their bid was. Something fun with this program was learning how to clear the screen. This could 
                be useful in the future when I try building different games that involve multiple people. Sometimes you shouldn't see the other person's input, so that is a solution I 
                was happy to learn about.

            <h4 class="q3">What I had issues with or excelled at</h4>
            <p>I had issues with debugging today. I normally like debugging but found it a bit frustrating today. Possibly since I worked all day before studying.</p>
            <h4 class="q4">Notes</h4>
            <p>Not the best programming day but not the worst. Though I had trouble grasping everything on my own, I was able to google and look at
                project examples to figure out what issues my programs were having.

                Hey, I'm Ash! I am currently studying Python and Web Development. This will be a documentation of my journey. I will post what I have been learning, what I excel at or struggle at. I will post links to finished repositories or talk about the projects I am working on. 
                The blog is mostly to track my own growth, but I am happy to share my journey with you!
